## Key Focus Areas

###  Automation in Data Warehousing

- Automation reduces manual intervention, minimizes errors, and enhances operational efficiency. Key components include:

- Automated Data Transformation: dbt enables automated transformation workflows by applying SQL-based transformations in a modular, scalable manner.

- CI/CD for Data Pipelines: Ensuring that transformations are tested before deployment to production.

- Version Control and Reproducibility: Leveraging git-based versioning to maintain and audit changes over time.

###  Observability & Monitoring

- Observability ensures that data pipelines are transparent, allowing engineers to detect and resolve issues proactively.

- Data Lineage Tracking: Understanding how data moves through your SQL data warehouse with dbtâ€™s dependency graphs.

- Data Quality Monitoring: Elementary provides real-time insights into data anomalies, freshness, and schema changes.

- Alerting & Reporting: Automatically generating alerts when data quality issues arise.

###  Incident Response & Resolution

- Ensuring that teams can respond effectively to data incidents minimizes business impact.

- Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Using lineage tracking to pinpoint failure points.

- Automated Notifications: Setting up alerts through Slack, email, or other communication tools.

- Resolution Playbooks: Defining clear steps to investigate, troubleshoot, and resolve issues.
