## POC Overview: dbt + Elementary Implementation

We have implemented a Proof of Concept (POC) using your existing SQL data warehouse to demonstrate:

### Data Transformation with dbt

Developed dbt models to perform incremental transformations on selected tables.

Implemented tests to validate data consistency, uniqueness, and referential integrity.

###  Data Lineage Tracking

Enabled dbt documentation to visualize how data flows across your SQL data warehouse.

Generated dependency graphs for enhanced visibility into upstream and downstream dependencies.

### Data Quality Monitoring with Elementary

Configured Elementary to track anomalies, freshness, and data drift.

Set up real-time alerts and dashboards to notify the team of potential data quality issues.
