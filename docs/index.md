As organizations scale their data infrastructure, ensuring the reliability, observability, and automation of their data warehouse becomes critical. This document outlines the key aspects of modern data warehouse operations—automation, observability & monitoring, and incident response—and demonstrates how dbt (Data Build Tool) and Elementary Data can be integrated into your existing SQL-based data warehouse to enhance data lineage tracking and quality monitoring.

We have prepared a Proof of Concept (POC) leveraging your current infrastructure to demonstrate these capabilities in action. The goal of this engagement is to showcase the value of dbt and Elementary Data in improving data trustworthiness and pipeline efficiency.
